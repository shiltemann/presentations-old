### Interactive learning via hands-on tutorials

![Screenshot with 2 web-browsers open side-by-side: one pointed at the current tutorial and the other at a Galaxy instance](assets/images/training/interactive_hands_on.png)

Note:

Designed to be interactive and built around Galaxy

### Hands-on tutorials built around a "research story"

![scale-70 border](assets/images/training/researchstoryfull.png)

Note:

Built around a "research story"
- Often reproduce an analysis from a publication
- Introduction
- Data upload (downsampling)
- Hands-on with different steps

Metadata to help trainees and instructors to keep track of the training goads
- Learning objectives
- Prerequisites
- Questions: Regular assessments with question boxes
